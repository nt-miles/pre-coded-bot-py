# pre-coded-bot-py
a discord.py starting base.

# what's changed since the last version:
- Username update

# MAIN Requirements:
- Python (any version works as long as it's supported by discord.py)
- Discord.py (this is the main Python package for discord.)

# starting the bot
double click the *.BAT file included in this repo to quickly start your bot.

# setting up your bot for first use
With any pre-coded bot comes the fact that it has no token and little personality. Discord has you covered though, just head to [The discord dev portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to create your bot (if you haven't) and grab it's token. this should ***NOT*** be shared with anyone, however. Once you have this token, set it in where "token_here" is on main.py, so the bot can activate.

# My other stuff (I guess):
